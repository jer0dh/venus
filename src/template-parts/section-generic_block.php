/*

get_sub_field will run wpautop on the wysiwyg field.  Using custom function this
wpautop is not run.

With wpautop and shortcodes in content, finding wp is adding empty <p></p> where it shouldn't.
If there was an unordered list there were <p></p> before and after the <ul></ul>.

Do_shortcode is also run by get_sub_field.

Still want wpautop for those that use visual tab.  So running it after.

Finding the results of the shortcode going through the wpautop will also add p tags between
certain tags.  If I used div for the icon as opposed to a span.  With the div an extra p
tag was added.  Using h3 instead of span also caused extra p tag.
